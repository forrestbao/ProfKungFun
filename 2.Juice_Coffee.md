# Agenda
1. Uni Cup Coffee: good artists copy, great artists steal
2. Juicero
3. What can a tech entreprenuer learn from the jokes? 

# What is Uni Cup Coffee? 
Some useful links (all in Chinese since Uni Cup Coffee is in China)
* [Blue Run China's offical Wechat news release](https://web.archive.org/web/20220705054445/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/S4coimA-H9W303uIvwcGSw)
* [from 36Kr, a famous Chinese tech news outlet](https://36kr.com/p/1812853575960194)
* [Uni Cup Coffee's JD store front](https://item.jd.com/10046478190293.html)

# Is Uni Cup Coffee really new?
* What [Nestle says on their webpage](https://www.nescafe.com/our-coffees/nescafe-gold)
* What [Wikipedia says about Nescafe's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nescaf%C3%A9)
* Conclusion: freeze-dried coffee has been there since at least 1965. 

# Uni Cup Coffee: good artists copy, great artists steal.
* It is a super brilliant idea. A super great deal for its investors. 
* Any coffee shop is a great investment in China. 
* "IQ tax" 
* The Chinese market is not about 1.4B people but the 200M urban and rich. 

# One more thing: who is the founder? 
He previously founded a coffee/co-work space called Cup One in Beijing, which sounds very famous in China.

# Juicero: a bad con artist
If Uni Cup were a great artist, Juicero is definitely a bad con artist. 
* Business model: copied from Keurig, but for juice. 
* [its website, web-archived, circa. 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160708185513/https://www.juicero.com/)
* [it's own commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oHp-VvhDE)
* Expensive: $699 for the machine (late reduced to $399) and $5-ish for the package. 

It was hot: 
* [New York Times, circa. 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160820184410/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/business/juicero-juice-system-silicon-valley-interest.html?_r=0)
* [Vogue, circa. 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160720170705/http://www.vogue.com/13421774/juicero-cold-pressed-juice-home-juicer-no-mess)

# How Juicero went wrong
* Price cut from $699 to $399 in January 2017. 
* [Bloomberg, April 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lutHF5HhVA)

# Why Juicero's fate differs from Uni Cup's potential one
* Business aspects
  * Price. $5 for a cup of juice vs. $1 for a cup of coffee. 
  * Coffee and juice are different: taste, sugar, impact. 
  * Juicero looks so much like blenders. 
  * Veggies can be eaten raw (salad) or sqeezed by hand or blenders. But brewing coffee is a chore and an art. 
  * Juicero's packs are perishable. Dried coffee is not. 
* Founder aspects
  * Doug Evans had no successful business. But Cup One is famous in China. 
* USA vs. China
  * American consumers are generally smarter than Chinese consumers.
  * American investigative journalism is much more powerful than that in China. 
  * In America, money is harder to buy words than in China. 

# Takeaway for tech entrepreneurs 
Face the dark reality: 

* Easier to make money by branding, framing something not novel than making a real innovation. 
* Branding and framing is very important. People pay for what they feel new and cool rather than what's really new or advanced. 
* Consumers can even pay for bullshit products sometimes (and often if in China), if they can feel good and they cannot verify that your product is useless.
