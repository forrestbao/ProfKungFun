# Welcome
- I am a professor of computer science. 
- My research and entrepreneur interests: AI/NLP and EDA/PCB.
- When I was 22 and after college, I emigrated to the US from China. 
- This video channel is about **evangelizing American Dream**:   
  1. technology entrepreneurship and 
  2. studying in the US for international students. (Most STEM PhD students in the US do NOT pay tuition and are paid decently to  research or to teach.)
- The channel will be in Mandarin Chinese. 
- Opinions of my own. 

# The name of the channel
- You know Kung Fu. 
- Here we pursue fun. So, Kung Fun. 
- Kung Fun (孔方) is also the Chinese idiom for money. 

# Why I decide to start this channel
- America is a great land of opportunites, welcoming and attracting talents from all over the world, from Alexander Bell to Elon Musk, from Albert Einstein to Guido von Rossum, from Chien-Shiung Wu (吳健雄) to Yitang Zhang (張益唐). 
- I have lived the American Dream and want to share the joy with more international talents. 
  1. some of my immigrant students are launching their startups and have gotten investments. 
  2. Too many international students, especially those in science and engineering and pursing PhD degrees, do not know that the opportunities to study for free legally are vast in America. I want to tell them that America is the land for people without rich parents. 

# Near-term episodes
- Professors and PhDs becoming rich:
    - National Instruments and LabVIEW
    - Mathworks and MATLAB/Simulink
    - SAS and SPSS
- Studying in America as a poor student from a third-world nation without rich parents
